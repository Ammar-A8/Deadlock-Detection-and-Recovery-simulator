# Deadlock-Detection-and-Recovery-simulator
Operating system project 


This project is a simulation of how operating systems detect and handle deadlocks. It demonstrates how processes compete for limited system resources and how a deadlock situation can be identified and resolved.

The program models resource allocation, process requests, and system state to show what happens when circular waiting occurs and how the system can recover.


# Project Objective

The goal of this project is to understand:

- What a deadlock is
- How deadlocks occur in operating systems
- How deadlock detection algorithms work
- Methods used to recover from deadlock

This simulator provides a practical implementation of theoretical OS concepts.



# Features

- Simulation of multiple processes and resources  
- Detection of deadlock using system state analysis  
- Identification of unsafe states  
- Recovery strategy to break the deadlock  
- Console-based interaction  



# Concepts Used

This project is based on the following operating system concepts:

- Resource Allocation Graph
- Deadlock conditions:
  - Mutual Exclusion
  - Hold and Wait
  - No Preemption
  - Circular Wait
- Deadlock Detection Algorithm
- Recovery by resource release or process termination



# Technologies Used

- Language: **C++**
- Environment: **Visual Studio**
- Platform: **Console Application**



# How to Run

1. Open `DeadlockProject.sln` in Visual Studio  
2. Build the project (Ctrl + Shift + B)  
3. Run the program (Ctrl + F5)
